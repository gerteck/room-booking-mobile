### Room Booking Mobile Application

A React Native Mobile App that demonstrates API Integration, data manipulation and device specific functionality.

This app aims to demonstrate the following:

* Fetches data from a REST API.   
* Sorts and displays the data dynamically.   
* Integrates a device-specific feature (e.g., camera).   
* Includes tests for critical functionality.
